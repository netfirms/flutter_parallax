/// A widget that applies a parallax effect on its child.
///
/// There are three options for constructing a [Parallax]:
///
///   1. The [Parallax.inside], that computes the parallax offset from its position
///   in its first [Scrollable] parent.
///   Useful for list or grid items.
///
///   2. The [Parallax.outside], that computes the parallax offset from the percentage
///   of the scrollable's container extent.
///   Useful for a list or grid background.
///
///   3. The [Parallax.custom] takes a [ParallaxDelegate], which provides the ability
///   to customize additional aspects of the child model. For example, a [ParallaxDelegate]
///   can control the algorithm used to computes the parallax offset of the child within its parent.

///  * [ParallaxSingleChildLayout], which uses a delegate to control the parallax layout of
///    a single child.
